# ARCHITECTURE: Blog Section Revitalization Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for revitalizing the blog section of our website, focusing on the content in `src/pages/blog` and `src/content/blog`. The plan aims to create a more engaging, accessible, and responsive blog experience while maintaining the technical integrity of the codebase.

## 1. Visual Theme & Layout

### Current State

The blog currently uses:

- A dark theme with gray-900 background and gray-200 text
- Simple list-based index with basic hover effects
- Minimal styling for individual posts with basic tag styling
- Tailwind CSS for styling, complemented by global.css and enhanced-theme.css

### Proposed Theme Enhancements

#### Color Scheme

- **Primary**: Leverage the existing primary blues (primary-500 to primary-900) for accents, buttons, and interactive elements
- **Background**: Create a subtle gradient background transitioning from gray-950 to gray-900 for added depth
- **Text**: Use a hierarchical text color system:
  - Headings: white/gray-50
  - Body text: gray-200
  - Secondary text: gray-400
  - Metadata: gray-500

#### Typography

- Maintain the 'MainFont' as primary font but introduce font-weight variations:
  - Blog post titles: font-bold (700)
  - Section headings: font-semibold (600)
  - Body text: font-normal (400)
- Increase line-height for better readability (leading-relaxed for body text)
- Implement responsive font sizing using Tailwind's text-base/lg/xl/2xl system

#### Blog Index Page Layout

- Implement a card-based grid layout instead of list view
- Each blog card should include:
  - Featured image area (with default image if none provided)
  - Title with hover effect
  - Brief excerpt (first 160 characters of description)
  - Publication date and read time
  - Author information with optional avatar
  - Tag pills with updated styling
- Add filter/category navigation above the grid
- Implement transitions for card hover states

````

#### Component Structure

- Create new reusable components:
  - `BlogCard.astro`: For individual cards in the index grid
  - `BlogTags.astro`: For consistent tag rendering
  - `BlogAuthor.astro`: For author information display
  - `BlogTableOfContents.astro`: For generating and displaying TOC
  - `BlogRelatedPosts.astro`: For showing related content
  - `BlogCodeBlock.astro`: For enhanced code display

#### CSS Updates Needed

- Create `src/styles/blog.css` for blog-specific styles
- Update `enhanced-theme.css` to include new blog theme elements
- Leverage existing Tailwind config and extend as needed

## 2. Markdown Formatting Standards

### Headings

- **H1**: Reserved for post title only (single use per post)
- **H2**: Major sections (e.g., "Introduction", "Conclusion")
- **H3**: Subsections within major sections
- **H4**: Minor points or special callouts
- **H5/H6**: Use sparingly for deeply nested content

```markdown
# Post Title (H1 - only used once)

_Metadata here_

## Major Section (H2)

Main content text...

### Subsection (H3)

More detailed content...

#### Special Note (H4)

Important callout information...
```

### Lists

- Unordered lists (bullets) for items without sequence importance
  - Use single level of nesting when possible
  - Maintain consistent capitalization within a list
- Ordered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
  - Each item should be a complete thought/sentence
  - End each item with appropriate punctuation

```markdown
## Unordered List Example

- First bullet point
- Second bullet point
  - Nested bullet point
  - Another nested bullet point
- Third bullet point

## Ordered List Example

1. First step in the process.
2. Second step in the process.
   1. Sub-step one
   2. Sub-step two
3. Third step in the process.
```

### Code Blocks

- Use triple backticks (```) with language specification
- Keep code blocks under 80 characters wide when possible
- Include comments for complex code
- Use syntax highlighting appropriate to the language

````markdown
```javascript
// Example JavaScript function
function example() {
  const data = fetchData();
  return data.filter((item) => item.active);
}
```
````

````

### Links
- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
- External links should open in new tabs with proper attributes
- Internal links should be relative paths

```markdown
[Descriptive link text](../relative/path) for internal links

[External resource name](https://example.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
````

### Images

- Always include alt text for accessibility
- Specify image dimensions when possible
- Caption images when appropriate
- Use consistent image sizing throughout posts

```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](../path/to/image.jpg)

<figure>
  <img src="../path/to/image.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text" width="600" />
  <figcaption>Caption explaining the image context</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Blockquotes

- Use for quotes, important callouts, or notes
- Attribute quotes when appropriate

```markdown
> This is an important note that readers should pay attention to.

> "This is a direct quote from someone."
> — Attribution
```

### Tables

- Include header row
- Align columns appropriately (left for text, right for numbers)
- Keep tables simple and readable

```markdown
| Name   | Type   | Default | Description      |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| param1 | string | null    | First parameter  |
| param2 | number | 0       | Second parameter |
```

## 3. Responsive Design

### Breakpoint Strategy

Implement a comprehensive breakpoint strategy using Tailwind's responsive prefixes:

- **Mobile-first** approach (base styling for small screens)
- **sm**: 640px and above
- **md**: 768px and above
- **lg**: 1024px and above
- **xl**: 1280px and above
- **2xl**: 1536px and above

### Layout Adjustments

- **Blog Index Page**:

  - Mobile: Single column cards, full width
  - sm: Single column with padding
  - md: Two column grid
  - lg: Three column grid
  - xl: Three column grid with increased spacing

- **Blog Post Page**:
  - Mobile: Single column, full-width reading area, no TOC sidebar
  - md: Increased padding and max-width for better reading
  - lg: Fixed table of contents sidebar appears
  - xl: Increased content width and sidebar spacing

### Component Adaptations

- **Navigation**: Collapsible on mobile, horizontal on larger screens
- **Code Blocks**: Horizontal scrolling on small screens, properly sized on larger screens
- **Images**: Responsive sizing with maximum width constraints
- **Tables**: Horizontal scrolling container on small screens
- **Author Bio**: Compact on mobile, expanded on larger screens
- **Related Posts**: Vertical stack on mobile, horizontal cards on larger screens

### Performance Considerations

- Implement lazy loading for images
- Optimize font loading with preload strategies
- Ensure critical CSS is inlined

## 4. Accessibility & SEO

### Accessibility Implementations

#### Semantic HTML

- Use appropriate HTML5 elements (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`, etc.)
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h6)
- Use `<time>` elements for dates

#### ARIA Attributes

- Add aria-label to links without descriptive text
- Use aria-hidden for decorative elements
- Implement aria-expanded for expandable sections
- Add aria-current="page" for current page in navigation

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement logical tab order
- Add visible focus states to all interactive elements
- Create skip-to-content link

#### Color & Contrast

- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text (WCAG AA)
- Maintain 3:1 contrast ratio for large text
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Test color combinations for color blindness issues

#### Screen Reader Support

- Add alt text to all images
- Implement proper ARIA landmark roles
- Ensure form labels are properly associated with inputs
- Test with screen reader software

### SEO Enhancements

#### Metadata

- Keep URLs concise but descriptive

#### Content Optimization

- Implement proper heading structure with keywords
- Optimize image filenames and alt text
- Create internal linking between related posts
- Include schema.org markup for content organization

#### Performance

- Optimize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Implement responsive images with srcset
- Add preload for critical resources
- Minimize render-blocking resources
