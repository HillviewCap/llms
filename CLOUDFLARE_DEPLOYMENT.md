# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide for LLMS.txt Explorer

This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the LLMS.txt Explorer to Cloudflare Pages with session support.

## Understanding the Session Configuration Error

The error `[SessionConfigWithoutFlagError] Session config was provided without enabling the experimental.session flag` can be confusing because:

1. You may already have `experimental.session: true` in your astro.config.mjs
2. The error still occurs during the Cloudflare build process

This happens because Astro with Cloudflare adapter requires **both**:
- The experimental flag in astro.config.mjs
- A KV namespace binding named "SESSION" for storing session data

Without the KV binding, Astro will throw this error even if the experimental flag is enabled.

## Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account
- Your project code pushed to a GitHub or GitLab repository
- Node.js 18.x or higher

## Step 1: Create a KV Namespace for Sessions

Astro's session support with Cloudflare requires a KV namespace:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Storage & Databases** in the sidebar
3. Select **KV** from the available storage options
4. Click **Create namespace**
5. Name it `astro-sessions` (or your preferred name)
6. Copy the namespace ID - you'll need this for the next step

## Step 2: Configure wrangler.toml

The project includes a `wrangler.toml` file that needs to be updated with your KV namespace ID:

1. Open the `wrangler.toml` file in your project
2. Replace `your-kv-namespace-id` with the ID you copied in Step 1
3. For local development with `wrangler dev`, create a preview namespace and replace `your-preview-kv-namespace-id`

Your `wrangler.toml` should look like this:

```toml
name = "llms-explorer"
compatibility_date = "2023-12-01"

# Required for Pages projects using wrangler.toml
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"

# KV Namespace binding for Astro sessions
kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "SESSION", id = "your-actual-kv-namespace-id", preview_id = "your-actual-preview-kv-namespace-id" }
]

[site]
bucket = "./dist"
```

The `pages_build_output_dir` property is required for Cloudflare Pages projects using wrangler.toml. Without this property, Cloudflare will consider the wrangler.toml file invalid and skip it during deployment.

## Step 3: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

### Option 1: Deploy via Cloudflare Dashboard (Recommended for first deployment)

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Workers & Pages** > **Pages**
3. Click **Create application** > **Connect to Git**
4. Select your repository and set up the build configuration:
   - **Project name**: `llms-explorer` (or your preferred name)
   - **Production branch**: `main` (or your default branch)
   - **Framework preset**: `Astro`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`
5. Under **Environment variables**, add any required environment variables
6. Click **Save and Deploy**

### Option 2: Deploy via Wrangler CLI

1. Install Wrangler CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. Log in to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. Build your project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:
   ```bash
   wrangler pages deploy dist
   ```

## Step 4: Configure KV Binding in Cloudflare Dashboard

After your first deployment, you need to add the KV binding to your Pages project:

1. Go to **Workers & Pages** in the sidebar
2. Click on your Pages project (e.g., llms-explorer)
3. Click on **Settings** > **Functions**
4. Scroll down to find **KV namespace bindings**
5. Click **Add binding**
6. Set **Variable name** to `SESSION`
7. Select your KV namespace from the dropdown
8. Click **Save**

## Step 5: Redeploy Your Application

After configuring the KV binding, trigger a new deployment:

1. Make a small change to your code and push it to your repository, or
2. In the Cloudflare Dashboard, go to your Pages project and click **Redeploy**

## Troubleshooting

### Session Configuration Error

If you see the error:
```
[SessionConfigWithoutFlagError] Session config was provided without enabling the `experimental.session` flag
```

This error is misleading because it suggests the experimental flag isn't enabled, when the real issue is usually the missing KV binding. To fix this:

1. Verify the `experimental.session` flag is set to `true` in your `astro.config.mjs` file
2. Ensure you have a `wrangler.toml` file with the SESSION binding configured
3. Create a KV namespace in Cloudflare Dashboard:
   - Navigate to **Storage & Databases** > **KV**
   - Create a namespace called "astro-sessions"
4. Configure the KV binding in your Pages project:
   - Go to **Workers & Pages** > Your project > **Settings** > **Functions**
   - Add a binding with variable name "SESSION" pointing to your KV namespace
5. Redeploy your application after setting up the KV binding

The error occurs because Astro's Cloudflare adapter checks for both the experimental flag AND the KV binding. If either is missing, you'll get this error, even if the flag is enabled.

### Invalid Binding Error

If you see the error:
```
Invalid binding `SESSION`
```

This means your KV namespace binding is not correctly configured. Follow Step 4 again to ensure the binding is properly set up in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

### Invalid wrangler.toml Error

If you see the error:
```
A wrangler.toml file was found but it does not appear to be valid. Did you mean to use wrangler.toml to configure Pages?
```

This means your wrangler.toml file is missing required properties for Pages projects. Make sure your wrangler.toml includes:

```toml
# Required for Pages projects using wrangler.toml
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"
```

Without this property, Cloudflare will consider the wrangler.toml file invalid and skip it during deployment, which means your KV namespace binding won't be applied.

## Local Development with Sessions

For local development with session support:

1. Install Wrangler:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. Create a preview KV namespace in the Cloudflare Dashboard and update the `preview_id` in `wrangler.toml`

3. Run the development server with Wrangler:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   wrangler pages dev dist
   ```
