### Plan for Table Width and Overflow Fix on LLMS.txt Explorer Page

#### Objective

Address the persistent horizontal overflow issue on the LLMS.txt Explorer page (`src/pages/index.astro`) where the table is too wide, preventing the "Last Checked" column from being visible. The previous fix attempt did not fully resolve the issue.

#### Root Cause

The primary cause of the overflow is likely a combination of:
1.  Fixed width classes (`w-1/3`, `w-2/5`, etc.) on table headers and data cells forcing the table to exceed the container width.
2.  Lack of `table-fixed` layout, allowing column widths to be determined by content, leading to unpredictable widths.
3.  Long content in columns like "Title", "Summary", and "LLMS.txt URL" pushing the table wider without proper constraints or truncation.

#### Solution

The revised plan to fix the table width and overflow involves the following steps:

1.  **Remove Fixed Width Classes:** Identify and remove or significantly reduce fixed width Tailwind classes (e.g., `w-1/3`, `w-2/5`, `w-1/6`, `w-1/12`) from `<th>` and `<td>` elements within the table structure. Allow Tailwind's default table layout or use `table-fixed` to control column widths.
2.  **Add `table-fixed` Layout:** Apply the `table-fixed` class to the `<table>` element. This tells the browser to use the first row's column widths as the width for all subsequent rows, making column width control more predictable.
3.  **Apply Content Constraints and Truncation:** For columns containing potentially long content ("Title", "Summary", "LLMS.txt URL"), apply appropriate Tailwind classes to constrain their maximum width and handle overflow.
    *   Use `max-w-xs`, `max-w-sm`, `max-w-md`, or similar classes on the `<td>` elements to set a maximum width for the column.
    *   Apply the `truncate` class to the content *within* the `<td>` (e.g., on the `<a>` tag for the URL, or a `<span>` or `div` wrapping the text in Title/Summary cells) to clip text and add an ellipsis if it exceeds the cell width.
    *   Ensure `whitespace-nowrap` is removed from cells where truncation is applied, as it conflicts with `truncate`.
4.  **Ensure Responsiveness:**
    *   The container wrapping the table (`#table-view`) should retain `overflow-x-auto` to enable horizontal scrolling on smaller screens where the table might still exceed the viewport width.
    *   The combination of `table-fixed`, `max-w-*`, and `truncate` should help the table fit within the viewport on larger screens.
5.  **Consider Mobile Hiding (Optional):** Evaluate if certain less critical columns (e.g., "Last Checked", "Status") could be hidden on smaller screen sizes using responsive utility classes (e.g., `hidden`, `sm:table-cell`) to improve usability on mobile. This is an optional enhancement.

#### Relevant Files and Sections

The fix will primarily involve modifications to the `src/pages/index.astro` file, specifically within the table structure.

-   The `div` with `id="table-view"` is the table container.
-   The `table` element needs the `table-fixed` class added and existing width classes removed/adjusted.
-   Table headers (`<th>`) and data cells (`<td>`) for "Title", "Summary", and "LLMS.txt URL" need fixed width classes removed/adjusted and `max-w-*` and `truncate` applied.
-   Other `<th>` and `<td>` elements (e.g., "Last Checked", "Status") may need width adjustments or responsive hiding classes.

#### Tailwind/CSS Classes to Use

-   `table-fixed`: Set table layout to fixed.
-   `max-w-xs`, `max-w-sm`, `max-w-md`, etc.: Set maximum width for table cells.
-   `truncate`: Truncate text with ellipsis.
-   `overflow-x-auto`: Add horizontal scrollbar if content overflows horizontally (already on the container).
-   `w-*` classes (e.g., `w-1/3`, `w-2/5`): Remove or reduce from `<th>` and `<td>`.
-   `whitespace-nowrap`: Remove from cells where truncation is applied.
-   `hidden`, `sm:table-cell` (Optional): Hide columns on small screens.
